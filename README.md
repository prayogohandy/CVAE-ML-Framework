# CVAE-ML-Framework
This study introduces a novel ML framework that integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for realistic data augmentation, aiming to enhance model robustness and generalization for the prediction of RC Shear Wall Failure Modes. Seven ML algorithms, including Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, were evaluated using datasets augmented by traditional oversampling techniques (ROS, SMOTE, ADASYN) and the proposed CVAE-based method. In addition, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was employed to interpret feature importance, providing engineering insights into the structural parameters influencing different failure modes.
